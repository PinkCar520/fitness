# Fitness App

## Project Overview

The Fitness App is a comprehensive iOS application designed to help users track their health metrics, manage fitness goals, and receive personalized recommendations. Built with modern Apple technologies like SwiftUI and SwiftData, it offers a seamless and intuitive user experience for managing personal fitness journeys.

## Features

*   **Health Metric Tracking:**
    *   Track and visualize weight, body fat percentage, and waist circumference over time.
    *   Integration with Apple HealthKit for seamless data synchronization (steps, distance, active energy, workouts).
*   **Personalized Onboarding:**
    *   An interactive onboarding flow to gather user fitness goals, experience level, preferred workout location (home/gym), and health conditions.
    *   Tailors initial fitness plans and recommendations based on user input.
*   **Fitness Profile Management:**
    *   Detailed user profile settings including basic information, health goals, training preferences, owned equipment, motivation factors, challenges, dietary habits, water intake, sleep quality, and physical benchmarks (e.g., push-ups).
    *   Allows users to refine their profile over time for increasingly personalized experiences.
*   **Dynamic Plan Generation:**
    *   Generates workout and meal plans based on user profile data, including workout frequency and available equipment.
*   **Achievement System:**
    *   Unlocks achievements and badges to motivate users (e.g., for setting motivators).
*   **Smart Recommendations:**
    *   Provides personalized dietary and workout recommendations based on user habits and goals.
*   **Dashboard & Statistics:**
    *   A customizable dashboard to view key metrics at a glance.
    *   Detailed statistics and historical trends for various health data.
*   **Input Sheet:**
    *   Easy-to-use interface for logging new weight, body fat, or waist circumference measurements.
*   **Widgets:**
    *   (Assumed from `WeightWidgets` directory) Provides quick access to key information directly from the home screen.

## Technologies Used

*   **SwiftUI:** Declarative UI framework for building native iOS applications.
*   **SwiftData:** Modern data persistence framework for managing application data.
*   **HealthKit:** Apple's framework for integrating with health and fitness data.
*   **Combine:** Reactive framework for handling asynchronous events.
*   **Charts:** Apple's framework for creating data visualizations.

## Installation and Setup

To run this project locally, you will need Xcode installed on a macOS machine.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    cd fitness
    ```
2.  **Open in Xcode:**
    Open the `fitness.xcodeproj` file in Xcode.
3.  **Resolve Dependencies:**
    Xcode should automatically resolve any Swift Package Manager dependencies.
4.  **Build and Run:**
    Select your target device or simulator and run the application.

**Note:** HealthKit integration requires proper entitlements and user authorization. Ensure these are configured correctly in your Xcode project settings.

## Usage

Upon first launch, new users will be guided through an onboarding process to set up their initial profile and preferences.

*   **Dashboard:** View your progress, daily activity, and personalized recommendations.
*   **Input Sheet:** Tap the '+' button (or similar) to log new weight, body fat, or waist circumference measurements.
*   **Profile:** Access and update your personal information, health goals, and fitness preferences.
*   **Plan:** See your generated workout and meal plans.
*   **Stats:** Dive deeper into your historical health data and trends.

## Screenshots

## Roadmap / Future Enhancements

*   Further refinement of the dynamic plan generation algorithm to incorporate more user data points.
*   Expansion of the achievement system with more diverse challenges and rewards.
*   Integration of a shared framework for better code sharing between the main app and widgets.
*   Advanced analytics and insights based on user data.
